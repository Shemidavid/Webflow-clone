     <p class="sixthptag">Simple. Elegant. Coherent. The <span class="minimal" >minimal</span> web design trend is in.
     In fact, it has been for about as long as we can remember. These website examples prove that it isn’t what you do, but it’s the way that you do it.
     If you’re just starting out, building a website can seem like a massive chore. That’s why it’s great to have plenty of inspiration to keep you going.
     Simple doesn’t mean boring or plain. Quite the opposite. Once you know what to look for you’ll see that a simple minimalist website design is your best bet for site design in 2022.</p>

        <span class="eightptag">Mina</span>
     </div>
     <p class="tenthptag">Mina is a bright eCommerce website template from Zyro that allows you to create your own online store in minutes.
Mina makes use of the trend for bright colors but uses minimal navigation in the web page design so that things never get too busy visually.
The template’s strongest feature is the contrast between attractive colors and an obvious call to action which lets the user know exactly what to do.
It is a great template for anyone wanting to start selling online and works perfectly straight-out-of-the-box.
Like all Zyro templates, you can try before you buy. Build your online store first, and when you’re happy with the result you can get online for as little as $8.99 per month.</p>

    <p class="fourteenptag">Three colors – black, grey, and white. That’s all it takes to build a powerful yet playful contrast.
Scroll down this one-page site design and you will understand the narrative that underpins this person’s creative projects. It’s an About Us and Contacts page rolled into one.
If you click on an image, it will give you additional information about the story behind the picture, and maybe show a video or two.
Other than that, it’s a really intuitive way to demonstrate how a one-page website can be created and presented.</p>
